This is a tiny little script to COLORIZE any source code you have just copied.

I use this to copy-colorize-paste code into **Keynote** when doing code presentations,
which need more animations than **<a href="http://github.com/ktoso/scalaslide">ScalaSlide</a>** can provide.

I hereby release this script under **Beerware 2.0**, which means that if you use it and it helped you somehow, then if we meet in person, you are free to buy me a beer (or slice of pizza).

(I'm serious.)
